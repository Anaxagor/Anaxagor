### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Irina Deeva
#### AI/ML researcher in the NSSLab at ITMO University

I am engaged in the study of Bayesian networks and modeling of real world objects using Bayesian networks.

I am one of the main developers of [BAMT](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT) - a framework for working with Bayesian networks.

I also manage the 'BNgroup' team, you can read about our achievements here:
[An article about how to model oil and gas using BN](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77961-0_33)
[An article about how to generate synthetics using BN](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77961-0_33)
